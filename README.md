variables:

version = 'corrected' version appears after error disovered in testing_stimuli, the consistent-allergy conidition had a stimulus 2 pairing, which should never have been the case. Per Phil Corlett, previous data is not compromised for key trial types. However, low level controls (I-,J+) should not be used in combined analysis of tasks without version 'correct' variable!

# Kamin Blocking
This is a psychological task designed to track new causal belief formation. It involves subjects learning to associate causes (foods) with effects (allergies in a fictitious patient).

The scenario is as follows: subjects imagine they are an allergist and they are charged with figuring our which foods cause allergies in a fictitious patient and which ones do not. They see each meal he has eaten (comprised of one or two different foods) , for 3 seconds then they see whether or not an allergy happened (for one second). When a meal is on the screen, they make a prediction with a 2-alternative button push (allergy or no allergy).

# Alternate versions
Three new versions were developed that (a) use different instructions/framing contexts (social vs. nonsocial), (b) different stimuli (social avatars vs. fractals), and (c) have shorter format based on (Ongchoco et al., 2023)

    Windows:

        cd C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\foodAllergy

## Hosting Guide  

#### Clone the git repository:
1. Open Terminal and navigate to the your server's default directory:

    Apache Linux default directory:

        cd /var/www/html

2. Clone respository:

        git clone https://github.com/belieflab/foodAllery.git

#### Modify permissions:
3. Execute these two chmod commands in terminal from  /var/www/html (the directory you are already in).

        sudo chmod -R 755 foodAllergy/
        sudo chmod -R 777 foodAllergy/data
        
this version is correct
